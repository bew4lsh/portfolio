## Project Overview

This predictive analytics project focused on reducing hospital readmissions by identifying high-risk patients and enabling proactive interventions. Using machine learning techniques on clinical and demographic data, we developed a model that achieved 87% accuracy in predicting 30-day readmission risk.

## Problem Statement

The healthcare facility was facing:
- **High readmission rates**: 15.2% within 30 days (above national average)
- **Limited early warning system**: No systematic way to identify at-risk patients
- **Resource allocation challenges**: Difficulty prioritizing discharge planning
- **Regulatory pressure**: CMS penalties for excessive readmissions

## Key Results

### Model Performance
- **87% accuracy** in predicting 30-day readmissions
- **31% reduction** in actual readmission rates
- **$2.3M annual savings** through reduced penalties
- **85% user adoption** rate among clinical staff

### Technical Implementation
```python
# XGBoost model with clinical feature engineering
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
import pandas as pd

def predict_readmission_risk(patient_data):
    # Feature engineering for clinical data
    features = engineer_clinical_features(patient_data)
    
    # Load trained model
    model = load_model('readmission_model.pkl')
    
    # Generate prediction and risk factors
    risk_score = model.predict_proba(features)[0][1]
    risk_factors = identify_risk_factors(features, model)
    
    return {
        'risk_score': risk_score,
        'risk_level': categorize_risk(risk_score),
        'top_risk_factors': risk_factors[:5],
        'recommendations': generate_care_plan(risk_factors)
    }
```

### Key Insights
- **Previous admissions** were the strongest predictor (18.3% feature importance)
- **Comorbidity index** and **medication complexity** highly correlated with risk
- **Social determinants** accounted for 25% of readmission variance
- **Length of stay** showed inverse correlation with readmission likelihood

This project demonstrates the successful application of machine learning in healthcare, providing both immediate clinical value and measurable business impact through reduced readmissions and improved patient outcomes.
